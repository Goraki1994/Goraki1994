- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there,nice to meet you. My name is Goraki. 

- ðŸ‘€ I've a fascination with how systems work, how they break and how they can be made to do things they are not supposed to. 

- Network Administration and Cyber Security, with a focus on Penetration Testing and Security Research is somewhat of an obsession of mine. 

- Currently volunteering at the Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure as a Security Researcher.
